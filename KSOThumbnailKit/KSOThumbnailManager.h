/**
 KSOThumbnailManager vends thumbnail operations for URLs, both local and remote.
 
 The following UTIs are supported:
 
 - kUTTypeImage (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 - kUTTypeMovie (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 - kUTTypePDF (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 - kUTTypeHTML (iOS/macOS)
 - kUTTypeRTF (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 - kUTTypeRTFD (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 - kUTTypePlainText (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 
 The following file extensions are supported:
 
 - ppt, pptx (iOS/macOS)
 - doc, docx (iOS/macOS)
 - xls, xlsx (iOS/macOS)
 - key (iOS/macOS)
 - pages (iOS/macOS)
 - numbers (iOS/macOS)
 - csv (iOS/macOS)
 
 There is special support for the following URL hosts:
 
 - vimeo.com (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 - www.youtube.com (iOS/tvOS/macOS)
 
 On macOS, if a something is not natively supported by the framework, it will fall back to the QuickLook framework, which can produce thumbnails for almost any format on the host system.
 
 A shared manager is provided via the sharedManager class property. You can also create your own instances using the initWithIdentifier: designated initializer.
